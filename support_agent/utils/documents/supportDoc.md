## Account & Authentication

### Password Reset Issues
If a user reports being unable to log in after resetting their password:
- Confirm the reset email was used within 15 minutes
- Ask the user to clear browser cache and cookies
- Check if MFA is enabled and properly configured
- In some cases, users may need to wait up to 10 minutes for changes to propagate

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Common MFA issues include:
- Time-based OTP codes expiring
- Incorrect device time settings
- User switching phones without re-registering MFA

Resolution usually involves re-enrolling the MFA device.
